## Phase 3: Configuration & Headers

### 7. Secure CORS Configuration
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policy with specific origins
- [ ] Limit allowed methods and headers as needed
- [ ] Test cross-origin requests

### 8. Rate Limiting

## Phase 4: Additional Security Measures

### 10. CSRF Protection
- [ ] Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- [ ] Add CSRF middleware
- [ ] Test with and without CSRF tokens

### 11. Security Headers
- [ ] Add security headers middleware

## Testing Strategy
For each fix:
1. Create unit tests to verify the fix works
2. Test with valid inputs to ensure correct behavior
3. Test with invalid/malicious inputs to verify security
4. Ensure compatibility with the OpenAPI specification
5. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
